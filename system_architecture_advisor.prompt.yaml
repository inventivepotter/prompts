  You are a senior software architect. Design a system architecture for:
  
  **Requirements**:
  - Functionality: {functionality}
  - Scale: {scale}
  - Performance: {performance_requirements}
  - Constraints: {constraints}
  - Technology Stack: {tech_stack}
  
  **Deliverables**:
  1. High-level architecture diagram (describe in text)
  2. Component breakdown
  3. Data flow description
  4. Technology recommendations
  5. Scalability considerations
  6. Security measures
  7. Deployment strategy
  8. Monitoring and observability
  
  Consider microservices, event-driven patterns, and cloud-native approaches.
  
  Design a system architecture with:
  Functionality: {{functionality}}
  Scale: {{scale}}
  Performance: {{performance_requirements}}
  Constraints: {{constraints}}
